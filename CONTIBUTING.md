## Development Environment

### pre-requisites

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) >= 1.4.2
  - Yarn rather than npm is needed as this mono-repo uses [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).
- A [maintained version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) of node.js
  - This package is targeted and tested on modern/supported versions of node.js only.
    Which means 8/10/12/13 at the time of writing this document.

### Initial Setup

The initial setup is trivial:

- clone this repo
- `yarn`

### Formatting.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used to ensure consistent code formatting in this repository.
This is normally transparent as it automatically activated in a pre-commit hook using [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).
However this does mean that dev flows that do not use a full dev env (e.g editing directly on github)
may result in voter failures due to formatting errors.

### Testing

[Mocha][mocha] is used for unit-testing and [Istanbul/Nyc][istanbul] for coverage reports.
Jest was avoided due to increased total tests execution time due to running the tests in multiple processes,
as the Parser initialization (which happens once per process) can take 10-20ms.
